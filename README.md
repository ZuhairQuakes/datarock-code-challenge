# Predictive Modeling for Proximity Classification in the Broken Down Lead Deposit

The Broken Down lead deposit in Tasmania presents a significant opportunity to improve exploration efficiency by classifying geochemical samples into zones closer to or farther from the orebody. By identifying these zones, drilling efforts can be prioritized, costs reduced, and resource estimation improved.

A predictive model using geochemical assay data (8 key elements: As, Au, Zn, Fe, S, Cu, Mo, Pb) was developed with XGBoost, a leading machine learning algorithm.

Key takeaways include:

• Strong Performance: Achieved 87.0% accuracy on the test set, with robust classification of samples closer to the orebody (Class A).

• Key Predictors: Lead (Pb) and Arsenic (As) emerged as the most influential factors for proximity classification.

• Practical Impact: Enables exploration teams to focus on high-priority areas, leading to faster and more cost-effective decision-making.

While the model performs well for proximal zones, refinement is needed for distal samples.
